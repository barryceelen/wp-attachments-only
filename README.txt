Simplify the default WordPress media view by removing all functionality except adding, deleting and rearranging attachments.

== Description ==

Sometimes you donâ€™t need all the bells and whistles of the WordPress attachment media view. This plugin takes that to the extreme and replaces the default WordPress media uploader view with a simplified version. It only allows adding, removing and rearranging attachments to a post.

**Gotchas:**

The plugin in its current state, due to my lack of experience with the subject matter, is a bit of a hack and could use some improvement:

- Currently does not support (or even allow) setting a featured image.
- As the default media viewer is replaced, any plugins extending that will not work.
- Ideally a future version would optionally allow all other default actions like inserting media and galleries, except when using unattached media files.
